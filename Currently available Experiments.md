**Mass and spring vertical oscillator:**   
    An electromagnet is attached to a motor through a long screw and can be moved vertically up and down.  At the beginning it is magnetized and as it rises 
    it attaches the mass which is made from iron.  Then it moves down to pull down the mass and extend the spring.  At that moment it is 
    demagnetized and the mass starts to oscillate up and down. The motion of the mass is measured through an ultrasound distance sensor.
    The setup is shown in the picture:

**Refraction and Reflection of light**   
    A transparent cylinder is mounted on a disk dial graded in degrees, starting at zero degrees at the vertical axis and clockwise or counterclockwise.
    is taking values from 0 to 90 degrees.  The transparent cylinder is filled up to the middle with a liquid. A laser can be rotated through a step motor
    at any desired angle relative to the center of the free liquid surface.  The laser beam can be refracted as it enters the liquid from air and the angle 
    of the refracted bean can be measured on the dial.  If the laser beam enters the liquid and then the air it is also refracted and the refraction
    angle can be mearured on the dial.  If the laser beam incidents the free liquid surface in an angle greater than a critical angle, then perfect 
    reflection will be observed

**Simple pendulum**   
    A mass is hanged by a thin metallic road and can swing if it is initial drawn away from the vertical.  The initial angle is set using a step 
    motor and a string attached to it and connects it to the metallic rod.  When the motor is activated the rod angle from the vertical increases
    until the rod reaches an energized electromagnet and is held there. When the electromagnet is deactivated, the pendulum starts to swing back 
    and forth.  It's angle relative to the vertical is measured, and  data on the variation of the angle versus time are recorded for analyzing
    the motion.

**Energy boxes**   
Polystyrene storage boxes where a window is cut and single or multiple glasses panels were placed.  These energy boxes are exposed to the
environment and the temperature versus time inside and outside will be recorded for analyzing the energy behavior of each case.

**Robotic arm**   
A robotic arm to perform physics motion experiments like for example free fall, motion on an inclined plane.
